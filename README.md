# Video Game Project in Java

## Overview
This project is a video game I started developing during my Christmas vacation. Initially, I followed a tutorial to get the basic structure and mechanics of the game, but I have since restructured and optimized most of the code to improve its cleanliness and performance. Additionally, I have implemented design patterns to make the code more maintainable and scalable.

## Current Status
The project is still in progress. While the core mechanics and structure are in place, I plan to complete the game by the end of my school project session. 

## Features (Planned)
- Basic game mechanics (movement, scoring, etc.)
- Optimized codebase
- Clean architecture and use of design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer)
- Future enhancements and polish before finalizing

## Technologies Used
- Java

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   `[git clone https://github.com/bestrider14/TowerDefenceTuto.git]`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile and run the project using your preferred IDE or via the command line.

## To Do
- Finish implementing additional game features and levels
- Polish graphics and user interface
- Complete testing and bug fixing
